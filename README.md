# Youth Games: Be Part of Tomorrow's Europe

Youth Games is an annual European-wide competition designed to unite young Europeans, enhance their learning experiences, and strengthen their sense of belonging to the European Union. Our mission is to bring together European youth in a collaborative environment that fosters education, teamwork, and cultural exchange.

## Problem Statement

A German study published on EDN Hub reveals that 4 out of 5 young Europeans feel more connected to their own country than to the European Union. This highlights the need for initiatives that promote a collective European identity among the youth.

## Objectives

- **Unite European Youth**: Create opportunities for young Europeans to connect and collaborate.
- **Enhance Learning**: Provide educational experiences that deepen understanding of the EU.
- **Foster European Identity**: Strengthen the sense of belonging to the European community.

## Concept Overview

Youth Games is structured in two phases:

1. **Digital Phase**: Participants engage in mini-games and learning experiences through our mobile application, competing to qualify for the grand finale.
2. **Grand Finale**: A physical event where finalists from various countries form teams to compete in a series of challenges.

## Target Audience

Our primary audience is European Union students aged 18 to 25, in partnership with higher education institutions. There are approximately 31.5 million students in Europe, according to key figures from Campus France.

## Participation Benefits

Participants have the chance to win internships or apprenticeships with our partner organizations, providing valuable professional opportunities.

## Core Principles

- **Youth-Led European Experience**: Empower young people to actively engage with and shape the future of the EU.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Encourage teamwork, communication, and mutual understanding among participants.
- **Continuous Engagement**: Maintain community engagement throughout the year with ongoing activities and preparation for future events.

## Game Design & Development

- Create a database of questions/answers with different difficulty levels.
- Implement a multiple-choice response system.
- Develop a progression system with feedback for correct/incorrect answers.
- Assign points based on response time and difficulty level.

### Front-End Development (FlutterFlow)

- Display an impact screen showing collective achievements (e.g., “10,000 trees planted thanks to your points!”).

## Testing & Optimization

- Conduct UI/UX tests on multiple mobile devices.
- Perform latency and performance testing for multiplayer mode.
- Ensure question/answer consistency and adjust difficulty levels.
- Validate leaderboard and scoring calculations.
- Fix any bugs or stability issues.

## Deployment & Presentation
